# Deepseek R1 with support for (Roo) Cline tools

This repository includes a modelfile sample for the models hosted on [ollama.com/tom_himanen/deepseek-r1-roo-cline-tools/tags](https://ollama.com/tom_himanen/deepseek-r1-roo-cline-tools/tags).

The repository also has a script that generates variants of the sample modelfile with different combinations of context length, quantization and temperature to fit everyone's needs. The script also pushes those variants to ollama automatically.

If you have suggestions on how to make this model work better with Cline, please feel free to create a pull request or tell me about your idea in the [Issues](https://github.com/erkkimon/deepseek-r1-roo-cline-tools/issues) section.
